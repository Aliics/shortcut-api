# shortcut-api

The shortcut api wrapped as a simple [Go](https://go.dev) library. Out of the box, there is a shortcut CLI tool, for
querying and updating your shortcut workspace.

# CLI installation

To install the CLI, you simply need to use the `go get` command.

> go get github.com/aliics/shortcut-api/cmd/shortcut-cli

As long as your `$GOBIN` is on your `$PATH`, this will allow you to use the `shortcut-cli`.
