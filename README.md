# shortcut-api

The shortcut api wrapped as a simple [Go](https://go.dev) library. Out of the box, there is a shortcut CLI tool, for
querying and updating your shortcut workspace.

# Maintenance warning

This project is under development, meaning the API or logic is not stable.
That being said, going forward, this library will become more mature and by 1.x it should be "production ready".

# CLI installation

To install the CLI, you simply need to use the `go get` command.

> go get github.com/aliics/shortcut-api/cmd/shortcut-cli

As long as your `$GOBIN` is on your `$PATH`, this will allow you to use the `shortcut-cli`.
